# Github Jenkins Integration

## Authentication with Github


Following steps are required for the Authentication.

### Configuration Github

* Go to the Github Page and visit https://github.com/settings/applications/new to create a GitHub application registration or in 'settings' - 'OAuth Apps' - 'New OAuth App'. The values for application name, homepage URL, or application description don't matter. They can be customized however desired.

* However, the authorization callback URL takes a specific value. It must be https://jenkins.example.com/securityRealm/finishLogin where                 
jenkins.example.com is the location of the Jenkins server.

* The important part of the callback URL is /securityRealm/finishLogin
Finish by clicking Register application.



### Configuration Jenkins

* Go to 'manage Jenkins' - 'Configure Global Security' and activate the 'Global GitHub OAuth' Settings
 
* Put in your values and credentials as seen in the screenshot
